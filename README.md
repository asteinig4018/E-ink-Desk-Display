## About E-ink Displays
E-ink displays can display a variety of pictures, texts, and charts in black and white or grayscale. Notably, the images stay even when the device is not powered. This provides a low-power always-on display. However, they do have some limitations, other than the lack of color. Generally, these displays can only be infrequently updated (every couple seconds as opposed to ms response times on LCDs) and usually require an entire screen redraw. The full screen redraw creates a noticeable effect as everything is rewritten. Some E-ink displays (such as the one I am using) do allow for specific areas to be updated, but this can be buggy.
